# Le Diode

You are the semitransparent hole.
Your role is to catch as much as posible
of the red, yellow and green spots.
But be aware of the blue one.
You can move to the left or to the right.
But do not try to move over the extreme position,
or you will hear the anoing sound of concert pitch.
As more points you have, the faster the game it is.
The model of the game is possitive, so you can let it be,
and just wath the feedback on the controller.
